[Think Stats Chapter 4 Exercise 2](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2005.html#toc41) (a random distribution)

#Question 3: Chapter 4 Exercise 2 - random distribution

#The numbers generated by random.random are supposed to be uniform between 0 and 1; that is, every value in the range should have the same probability.
#Generate 1000 numbers from random.random and plot their PMF and CDF. Is the distribution uniform?


from __future__ import print_function, division

import numpy as np

import nsfg
import first
import thinkstats2
import thinkplot

t = np.random.random(1000)


pmf = thinkstats2.Pmf(t)
thinkplot.Pmf(pmf, linewidth=0.1)
thinkplot.Config(xlabel='Random variate', ylabel='PMF')


cdf = thinkstats2.Cdf(t)
thinkplot.Cdf(cdf)
thinkplot.Config(xlabel='Random variate', ylabel='CDF')

#Yes, the distribution is uniform
